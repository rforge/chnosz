      <h3>Basic Rpad home page</h3>

      <p>Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis program. Rpad pages
      are interactive workbook-type sheets based on R, an open-source
      implementation of the S language. Rpad is an analysis package, a
      web-page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad
      makes it easy to develop powerful data analysis applications that
      can be shared with others (most likely on an intranet). The user
      doesn't have to install anything--everything's done through a
      browser.</p>
