**************  Version 1.3.0, 2007-04-24

	Updated javascript loading to make Rpad pages load faster - split
	out gui code, and don't load by default. This is the main reason
	for the version jump -- it shouldn't affect Rpad pages, but it is
	a sizeable change. It reduces initial loading from 15 sec on
	www.rpad.org to about 8 sec.
	
	Bugfix (http://code.google.com/p/rpad/issues/detail?id=3) in
	quoting JS strings for reading in .R and .RData files.

	Fixed problem found by Roger where 'x' was interpreted as F9
	(calculate) on IE. In the process, I changed the key event code to
	use Dojo's new onkey event, which is "normalized", so hopefully,
	it will have better cross-platform support.
	
	Disabled the "page loading..." popup. It was more trouble than it
	was worth, especially on CGI installations.
	

**************  Version 1.2.1, 2006-12-15

	Made the login to R more "load and go". This fixes a bug for CGI
	server installations where the page loading message never goes
	away.

	Added the function "R" to execute R commands from the FireBug
	console -- handy for debugging pages on servers.

**************  Version 1.2.0, 2006-12-12

	Updated Dojo to 0.4.1. This is a more stable release and supports
	more useful widgets like a sortable table.

	Fixes to make Rpad more compatible with R2HTML.

	Added json generation to facilitate transfering R data to the browser.

	Added the capability (still imperfect though) to use other
	graphics devices (like GDD) with Rpad.

	Improvements to the "H" code generation.

	Added a throbber that activates when Rpad is communicating with
	the server.

	Added a drag-and-drop utility. See the DataModeling.Rpad file.
	
**************  Version 1.1.1, 2006-03-05

	Fix to RpadUtil.Rd to prevent the example from leaving behind 
	a data file.

	Changed it to load R2HTML if it is there using require.
	
**************  Version 1.1.0, 2006-02-17

	This is the first release based on the Dojo toolkit. The
	client-side code was completely revamped. The old client code is
	still present, so old pages *should* work without change. 

	The code for HTML generation was revamped. A new function "H" was
	introduced to make it easier to generate proper html from within
	R. This is the most likely source of incompatibility with previous
	versions. 

	The mini webserver in R/Tcl was rewritten. It is now based on
	mini1.1.tcl from the tclhttpd webserver
	(http://www.tcl.tk/software/tclhttpd/). It tries to keep socket
	connections open if possible. That seems to reduce the problem of
	the server locking up (until you hit a return at the R command
	prompt). 

	The little-used function "fspdf" was removed. 
	

**************  Version 0.9.6, 2005-07-18

	Reverted back to using HTMLArea's getHTML instead innerHTML to
	save documents. There are tradeoffs with each. Both are buggy, but
	getHTML is more controllable and more flexible. It would be best
	to switch to a more robust getHTML. FckEditor seems to have a more
	robust version.

**************  Version 0.9.5, 2005-06-20

	Replaced \r\n with \n when saving so that TEXTAREA's won't get
	double spaced after saving. Also tweaked the wrapping of
	TEXTAREA's.

	Replaced the JSCookMenu with a previous version so insert div,
	textarea, etc. works again under Mozilla.

	Reverted back to using innerHTML for inserting Rpad sections and
	textareas. This simplifies the code, and we don't worry about
	sections appearing in funny places. It does mean the user can do
	weird things like put Rpad sections inside of Rpad sections.

	Added a kludge to htmlarea_utils.js to improve saving of
	TEXTAREA's. Under Mozilla, innerHTML doesn't get updated when the
	user edits textareas (that's in the value property). Saving of
	changes to INPUT's is still buggy under Mozilla.

	Because TEXTAREA's now work better, some of the examples were
	changed to include TEXTAREA's for code sections. 

************** Version 0.9.4, 2005-06-13

	Added an adjustable timeout period (defaults to 30 minutes) in
	pipe.pm in the perl interface to R. Adjust .RPADTIMEOUTMINUTES in
	.RpadStartup.R to change it.

	Added initial support for file upload. See
	basehtml/server/fileupload.pl and RpadExtras.R.

	Added an option to change the quoting character in HTMLargs() in
	HTML.R. 

	Fixed a bug in Rpad_editor.js where PRE and TEXTAREA's got double
	spaced in internet explorer. Because PRE's work better, I changed 
	a bunch of the examples to use PRE's to format the R code better.
	
************** Version 0.9.3, 2005-05-13

        Per notice from Joel Hardi, removed --gui=none option from
	Statistics-R_perl_interface/lib/Statistics/Rpad/Bridge/Linux.pm
	because that option is depreciated in R 2.1.

	Fixed a bug with HTML saving. I had switched from HtmlArea's
	method of extracting the html to using the standard innerHTML, but
	I didn't get it fixed quite right. I changed
	HTMLArea.prototype.getHTML (in htmlarea_replacements.js and
	htmlarea_utils.js) to just use innerHTML. I'm still not sure it
	uses innerHTML properly.
	
************** Version 0.9.2, 2005-04-14

        Fixed a tcl bug in the local version of Rpad that made it
	fail under internet explorer under win XP.

	Removed the "checked=" parameter from HTMLcheckbox as it didn't
	work right. 
	
************** Version 0.9.1, 2005-04-13
	
        Made Rpad into a full R package that R users can run
	locally. Based on an idea from Philippe Grosjean, this version
	uses a built-in web server to serve the Rpad pages to a browser
	locally. The web server is a mini-webserver implemented in Tcl and
	launched from within R. With Tcl handling the communication with
	the browser, the user can continue to use the command line or
	other GUI. Several functions were added to maintain compatibility
	between the server version and the local version, mainly to keep
	track of different directory locations.
	
	Switched the default Rpad file extension to .Rpad -- .html will
	still work. The advantages for users are that they can keep track
	of Rpad files more easily. One disadvantage is that the server
	must serve .Rpad files as text/html.
	
	Changed all of the HTML generation utilities to always return a
	string (of class HTMLchunk). When used standalone, the automatic
	'print'ing feature of R will cat the output to the browser. Note
	that if a HTML generation function is used inside of a loop or
	other scenario where the function results are not automatically
	printed, then you need to enclose the function with cat or
	print. 
 
	Modified SearchRKeywords.html to add a button to allow the user to
	update the keyword database.

	Fixed a bug that prevented TEXTAREA's from being used as R input
	sections.

	Updated the code to allow the use of PRE sections with Rpad
	input sections. You can either use <pre class="Rpad_input"
	rpad_type="R"> or <div class="Rpad_input" rpad_type="R"><pre>. 
	This makes it easier to use an external HTML editor to edit Rpad
	files because it handles whitespace better.

	Added an R startup file for the server version of Rpad. Upon
	starting each Rpad page, the file .RpadStartup.R is source'd into
	R. This allows customizations, including changing default graphics
	devices.

	Improved the detection of various servers to get the directories
	right. This improves the compatibility with apache and
	apache2. Server support on windows was improved: apache, apache2,
	and IIS were all tested and documented.
	
	Added the ability for the Rpad page to choose between the "lite"
	and "heavy" editor for that page. In the html, before the <script
	type="text/javascript" src="editor/Rpad_loader.js"> </script>
	line, add: 
	    <script type="text/javascript">
              var Rpad_editmode = "lite";  // or "heavy"
            </script>

************** 2004/11/02 snapshot
	Changed the server perl code in Statistics-R to generate R code to
	always "require" R2HTML and RpadUtils. This eliminates the need to
	set the environment variable R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES and improves
	compatibility with apache2 and R 2.0.

	Changed HTML.data.frame in RpadUtils to be more compatible with
	the newest version of R2HTML (v. 1.4-3). In the future, RpadUtils
	should not need its own version of HTML.data.frame, but for now
	it's needed for slightly older versions of R.
	
	Changed R_process.pl to always send a header. Upon R login, it
	didn't send a header, so the perl process got stuck, which
	sometimes made Internet Explorer get stuck.

	Fixed a bug in saving (HTMLarea.getHTML) where values and names 
	of input boxes were being skipped.

	Fixed a couple of bugs when inserting text input boxes with focus
	not in the right place.
	
	Fixed a small bug in HTMLembed in RpadUtils.

	In RpadUtils.R, changed newgraph and showgraph to allow the EPS
	file to contain several images; each is converted to a separate
	PNG file. 

	Modified SearchRKeywords.html to always show the plots
	that were generated when the examples are run.

	Added two examples for adding GUI elements for adjusting plot
	parameters. 

	In Rpad_editor.js & Rpad_lite_editor.js, fixed a bug which unhid
	all elements (not just code) with "unhide all code". Fixed a bug 
	in Rpad_lite_editor.js which didn't call "unhide all code".

	Fixed a bug in htmlarea_replacements.js where hitting Enter in a
	text input box causes an error. Enter now works like it should in
	InterruptionHistory.html (it's equivalent to F9). 

	Escaped single quotes in string inputs for select boxes and Rstring input
	boxes, so strings like "John's data" are submitted correctly (as
	"John\'s data").
	
************** 2004/08/30 snapshot

	Fixed a bug preventing nonstring output from javascript Rpad input blocks.

	Added an Rpad/js & Rpad/img directories to house javascript code for
	GUI's. Added several htc files from Detlef Groth.

	Updated tablesort to work in Mozilla and disabled alternate row coloring.

	Changed 'RpadGraphOptions' to 'graphoptions' in RpadUtils.

	Fixed up Rpad_wrapper.css & Rpad_editor.js a bit to get rid of scroll bars and make
	it work right in Mozilla in "strict" mode with the heavy editor.

	Removed the requirement for a class of Rpad_input for Rpad input
	blocks. It now checks for the "Rpad_type" attribute instead. That
	way, you can format different types of input differently if you want.

	Added an example and R code to generate a gui to plot stuff and specify plot parameters.

	Added HTMLargs and HTMLelement to RpadUtils and cleaned up
	HTMLinput and similar functions.

	Changed Rpad_run_next_node to a nonrecursive version to get rid of
	out of stack errors in IE.

	Added a CSS attribute selector to change the color of an INPUT if
	it's an Rstring (versus Rvariable). It's mozilla only: attribute
	selectors don't work on IE.
	
************** 2004/07/18 snapshot

	Adds support for a "lite" editor not based on HTMLArea that's
	especially useful with Mozilla browsers. The lite editor does not
	embed an Iframe, so some things work better (like internal links
	in Rpad pages). Startup should be
	faster as well. The lite editor is the default on Mozilla
	browsers, but it can also be used in IE (you need to change the
	first line in Rpad_loader.js).

	Added the capability to specify default plot options (RpadGraphOptions).

	For Save and SaveAs, added checks on the server to make sure the
	file could be created.
	
	Renamed the Rpad_utils.R functions img, select, etc. to HTMLimg,
	HTMLselect, etc. This makes it more consistent with R2HTML, and
	commands are less likely to interfere with other packages.

	Fixes a carriage return problem on some output.

	Fixes a problem with multiple HTMLon and HTMLoff within the same
	R script area.

	Known problems: 

	Javascript Rpad sections seem broken.

	Select boxes or other inputs with quotation marks
	in the string are broken.

	Mozilla: F9 won't work from inside a select box.
