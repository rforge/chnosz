- How do I load my own updated data files?
  
  Put the file in your working directory (use getwd() to find it).
  Then use add.obigt("mydatafile.csv").
  The file has to be in the same format as OBIGT.csv that comes with the package.
  Use system.file("data/OBIGT.csv", package="CHNOSZ") to find where that file is installed.
  But do not modify that file itself... it gets overwritten with package updates!

- can I make a plot with log(aNa+/aH+) on an axis?

  Short answer: no, but plotting log(aNa+) would be numerically equivalent if you 
    set aH+=1 (pH=0) (if your problem permits).
  Long answer: not easily; only logarithms of chemical activities of basis species 
    (and temperature or pressure) can be the variables on the axes on plots made
    by diagram(). You could theoretically add a species with the composition
    of Na+ minus H+ to the database (it would have the formula "NaH-1+0" and the same
    properties as Na+) and use that as a basis species instead of Na+.
  Also, if you wanted an axis label like 'log(aNa+/aH+)' you'd have to add it
    manually, or modify the axis.label() function used by diagram().
