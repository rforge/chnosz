      <h2>Data input</h2>

      <p>There are several ways to input data into an Rpad.
      For large datasets, like dataframes, you can use a TEXTAREA as
      follows. This textarea is transfered to the server as a file (in
      this case named 'states.csv'),
      which you can read into R. This
      allows the user to paste in new data if they want. This is the state.x77 data that comes
      as a built-in dataset with R (from 1977 census data). </p>

<p>Now for some R code. Textareas can also be used for R code blocks.
This has the advantage that the user can edit the code
on Mozilla browsers without the Mozile plugin. It also allows larger
code chunks that don't take up as much screen space.
</p>

<p>Read in and plot this data:</p>

<textarea dojoType="Rpad" rows="6" cols="80">
a = read.csv('states.csv')
plot(a$Population, a$HS.Grad)
HTMLon()
showgraph()
</textarea>

      <p>You can also use HTML input boxes, so the user can enter
      single-valued data into R. There are two types of R variables
      that can be associated with an Rpad input box. One is
      "Rvariable" and it is an R expression, so it can contain 1.33 or
      2*pi or 3*x + sum(3,6,7). The other is "Rstring" and it is
      transfered to R as a character string. On Mozilla, the Rstring
      is colored blue to differentiate it (with a little CSS that IE
      doesn't support). You can change the name of the R variable and
      the type of R variable with the input and selection boxes at the 
      upper right of the browser page. Here are two Rpad variables
      called <code>myvar</code> and <code>myname</code>.</p>

      <p>myvar: <span contenteditable="false"><input class="Rpad_input" name=
      "myvar" rpadType="Rvariable" value="3*pi"></span>
      myname: <span contenteditable="false"><input class="Rpad_input" name=
      "myname" rpadType="Rstring" value="Tom"></span>
      </p>

      <p>After fiddling with some of the inputs, hit F9 or the
      calculate button and see that the following outputs change:</p>

<textarea dojoType="Rpad" rows="3" cols="80">
cat("myvar =",myvar,"\n")
cat("myname =",myname,"\n")
</textarea>

      <p><span contenteditable="false"><input onclick=
      "javascript:rpad.calculatePage()" value="Calculate" type=
      "button"></span> </p>
