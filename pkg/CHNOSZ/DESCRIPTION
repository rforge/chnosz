Description: Tools for thermodynamic calculations in compositional biology and
  low-temperature geochemistry. Thermodynamic properties are taken from a database
  including aqueous species, minerals, and biomolecules, or from amino acid group
  additivity for proteins. High-temperature properties are calculated using the
  revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations of state for aqueous species. Functions
  are provided to define a system using basis species, automatically balance reactions,
  calculate the chemical affinities of reactions for selected species, and plot the
  results on potential diagrams or equilibrium activity diagrams. Experimental functions
  calculate activity coefficients for aqueous species or optimize multiple thermodynamic
  variables using an objective function for chemical activities.
